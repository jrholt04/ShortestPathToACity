# ShortestPathToACity
This a basic implementation of dijkstra's algorithm that allows you to find the "shortest path" to a city based on the weight of the graph

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finding the Shortest Path to Your Destination

This is a basic implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, designed to help you find the shortest path to a city based on the weights of the graph. Whether you’re navigating a maze of roads or plotting a course through a network, this algorithm will guide you efficiently to your destination by considering the least-costly route at each step. Just input your graph, specify your starting point, and let Dijkstra’s algorithm do the rest!
